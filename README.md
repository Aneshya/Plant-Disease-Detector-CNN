# Plant Disease Detection AI MOdel

## Description
This project detects plant diseases by analyzing leaf images.  
The aim is to help identify plant health issues at an early stage using image-based classification.

## Objective
- To classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased
- To understand image preprocessing and classification techniques
- To implement a complete project workflow from data to results

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Dataset
- Leaf images of plants (healthy and diseased)
- Images were resized and normalized before processing
- Dataset obtained from Kaggle

## Working
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Performed image preprocessing  
3. Trained the model on processed images  
4. Evaluated predictions on test images  

## Output
- The system predicts whether a plant leaf is healthy or affected by disease
- Visual results are displayed for verification

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run the cells step by step  

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with image processing  
- Understanding of project implementation using Python  
- Improved problem-solving and debugging skills  

## Future Scope
- Improve accuracy with more data
- Create a simple web interface
- Extend the project for multiple plant types
