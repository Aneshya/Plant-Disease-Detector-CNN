# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection AI Model

## 📌 Description
This project detects plant diseases by analyzing leaf images.  
The aim is to help identify plant health issues at an early stage using image-based classification techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased  
- To understand image preprocessing and image classification techniques  
- To implement a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Leaf images of various plants (healthy and diseased)  
- Images were resized and normalized before training  
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle  

---

## ⚙️ Working
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Performed image preprocessing and augmentation  
3. Trained a deep learning model on processed images  
4. Evaluated predictions on test images  

---

## 🧪 Output
- The system predicts whether a plant leaf is **healthy** or **affected by disease**  
- Classification results are displayed visually for verification  

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook or application file in **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**  
3. Run the cells step by step to train or test the model  

⚠️ **Note:**  
The trained model weights (`.keras` file) could not be uploaded because the file size is large and exceeds GitHub’s upload size limit.

---

## 📘 Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with image processing  
- Understanding of deep learning-based classification  
- Improved debugging and implementation skills  
- Experience in building a complete AI project  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Improve accuracy using a larger dataset  
- Deploy the model using a web interface (Streamlit / Flask)  
- Extend support for more plant species and diseases
